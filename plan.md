## Analysis Workflow
1. Begin with Tier 1 for a rapid assessment of all files.
2. Proceed to Tier 2 for files identified as complex or critical.
3. Conduct Tier 3 analysis for files central to system architecture.
4. Perform Tier 4 analysis for key files or when deep insights are required.
5. Continuously cross-reference insights between sections and tiers.
6. Adapt the depth of analysis based on discoveries and the file's importance.

Remember: This plan is designed to be flexible. Adjust the depth and focus of analysis based on the specific characteristics of each file and its perceived importance in the system. Consider not just the correctness and clarity of the code, but also its efficiency, resilience, and potential impact on system resources. Think about how the code might behave in a production environment with real-world data volumes, user loads, and failure scenarios. The goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of the file's role, quality, and potential impact on the overall project, while identifying opportunities for improvement and optimization.
